## Overview
This is a QR-code component designed and built to the specification given in the Frontend mentor challenge pack.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am using Frontend mentor as a refresher/practice, so this challenge has helped me to go over and relearn different aspects of css, such as css variables, flexbox positioning and how to work with fonts. Getting reacquainted with using git commands and the stage and commit workflow has been helpful too.

### Continued development

Using devtools to inspect elements in greater detail and troubleshoot design issues.
